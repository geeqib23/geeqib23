As the username suggests, I am a geek who finds fun in tinkering with stuff. *no pls don't hate me i am not that boring*.
I love flashing different ROMS on my Android. *sorry i am boring, actually*.

I am learning web development, both front-end and back-end and Javascript is my girlfriend currently. I like the UX part and backend very much, as of now but I am trying to explore different fields of software to find what's my favourite.
