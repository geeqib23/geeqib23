As the username suggests, I am a geek who finds fun in tinkering with stuff. I am an sophomore at Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Allahabad. 
I am intrigued by Javascript frameworks and love to use them to build stuff on the web. Also, I am trying to explore a variety of tech to find out what's my favourite.
