As the username suggests, I am a geek who finds fun in tinkering with stuff. *no pls don't hate me i am not that boring*.
I love flashing different distros and operating systems on my Android and my PC.  *sorry i am boring, actually* .

I am intrigued by Javascript frameworks and love to use them to build stuff. Also, I am trying to explore a variety of tech to find out what's my favourite.
